Health Center Simulation

This is a simulation of an online medical appointment system using a hybrid
architecture of TCP and UDP sockets. The progam has three major phases: 1) authenticating into
the health center server, 2) requesting available appointments and reserving one of them, and 
3) sending insurance information to the corresponding doctor to get an estimated cost for the
visit.

In Phases 1 and 2, all communications are through TCP sockets. In phase3, however, all the
communications are over UDP sockets. The main components of this network architecture are:
1)one health center server which keeps track of available appointments and it is also in charge 
of giving out appointments to the requesting patients, 2) two patients who are going to ask the 
health center server for available appointments and reserve one of them (the health center 
server will coordinate the process to avoid any conflicts of the appointments), and 3) two 
doctors that can get requests from the patients and provide estimated costs of the visits
